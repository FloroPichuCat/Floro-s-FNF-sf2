# Floro-s-FNF-sf2
A bunch of FNF sf2 files and FNF chromatics made by me

[YOU CAN USE THESE SF2 FILES AND CHROMATICS AS LONG AS YOU CREDIT ME!!!!!!!!] (https://www.youtube.com/c/floropichucat)

List of sf2 so far:

-Bikini Bottom Funkin SpongeBob Voice

-SpongeBob screaming in vain

-SANS_FNF

(also like most of the sf2 can't do long notes and can sound a bit weird on the higher pitches, ALSO SANS_FNF IS LOUD)
(and the soundfonts mainly use one sample)

List of Chromatics so far:

-Figure form Roblox Doors

-Piggy from Roblox Piggy

-Baller form Roblox Boss Fighting Stages
